        <h3>There are few recipes I know how to make by heart, but this one I have made my own and prepare from memory!</h3>
        <p>
            If I recall correctly, the basis for this recipe came from a college cooking book aimed at providing easy filling meals for students.   It is simple to prepare and easy to dress up with a few optional garnishes.  If you want to go the extra mile try it with homemade tortillas!
